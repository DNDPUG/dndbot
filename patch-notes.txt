Changes for Version 1.2
	
1. New Weekly Sheet Creation:
	Every Friday at 6:00 PM Eastern Time, the bot automatically:
		Renames the current registration sheet to include the event date (e.g., General Info - MM/DD).
		Creates a new sheet for future signups with the title General Info.
		Copies over the header row to the new sheet to maintain consistent formatting.
2. Removed Signups Sheet:
	Registrations that are removed by users are now Appended to a dedicated "Removed Signups" sheet for better tracking.

Changes for Version 1.1
1. Realm Name Matching:
	Added a lookup system for server/realm names to ensure accurate entries.
	Users can now enter realm names even if they are slightly misspelled, and the bot will match them to the closest correct name.
2. Updated Registration Process:
	Added a 2-second delay between removing a previous registration and prompting for a new one to make the experience smoother.
	Removed the “Proceed Anyway” button to streamline the user experience if users need to re-register.
3. Sheet Changes:
	Rearranged data in Google Sheets to create a more organized format:
		Specifically, the column for Key Range now has a filter column next to it before the Special Requests field, allowing for further organization of data.
4. Improved Error Handling and Bot Reliability:
	Added several error handling improvements to ensure the bot runs more smoothly:
		Included safeguards to ensure the bot checks if a response is already completed before sending follow-up messages.
		Enhanced error logging to provide more detail if an issue arises during registration or when communicating with the Blizzard API or Google Sheets.
5. Logging Updates:
	Logging has been improved to give more context on any issues related to API responses or interactions with Google Sheets.
	This will help with diagnosing and fixing any problems that arise during registration or data retrieval.
6. Version Tracking:
	Implemented a versioning system for the bot.
	This release has been labeled as version 1.1. Changes prior to today are considered version 1.0.
